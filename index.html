            <p>
                I'm currently on a full time broadcast and film course at college. The decision to join this course came from a general interest I've had for many years, which I never quite had the means to pursue until recently.<br>
                <br>
                My skills mostly come into play as a camera operator, though I am also comfortable working with audio equipment, lighting equipment, video editing, colour grading, and most other tasks directly related to the creative process.<br>
                <br>
                I am one of the co-founders of <a href="https://thousandnine.com/" target="_blank">ThousandNine Media</a>, an indie production company.

            <h1 class="display-4">Photography</h1>
            <p>
                I am a hobbyist photographer, mainly focusing on experimenting with a variety of different techniques and technologies for the sake of producing interesting photos that I can be proud of.<br>
                <br>
                Taking this approach to photography, treating it as a hobby while the filmmaking is my career focus, allows me to try random ideas in my free time that I would never think of on set, but could still apply to future shoots.<br>
                <br>
                At the moment I am mainly shooting on 35mm film, whatever stocks I can get my hands on. My personal favourites so far are Kodak Gold, Kodak Ultramax overexposed 1 stop, Fomapan 400, and Yoru 400.<br>
                <br>
                The bird profile picture I currently use on most sites was a photo I took on a full spectrum modified Sony a5000 with a 720nm infrared filter.

            <h1 class="display-4">Development</h1>
            <p>
                I have been messing around with various forms of development for a large part of my life.<br>
                <br>
                Initially, I was a young child trying to write text based narrative games in Windows Batch, none of those became anything fruitful.<br>
                <br>
                Early in high school, we happened to be taught basic HTML and CSS in an ICT class, I enjoyed it, and have been writing my own websites ever since. I much prefer the fine control this approach gives me over the oversimplified drag and drop site builders.<br>
                <br>
                I've also experimented with various programming languages, particularly taking a liking to Python and Rust. This allowed me to create tools such as AutoTCLog-RS, an automated timecode logging program.
