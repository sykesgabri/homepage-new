            <p>
                I'm currently on a full time broadcast and film course at college. The decision to join this course came from a general interest I've had for many years, which I never quite had the means to pursue until now.<br>
                <br>
                I am working on developing a range of skills related to this industry, and I plan on making some personal projects down the line to further develop these skills and put out some hopefully entertaining stuff.

        <div class="container-fluid pt-5 text-white text-center gs-content" id="webdev">
            <h1 class="display-4">Web Developer</h1>
            <p>
                I have been coding websites by hand ever since I was about 13, and I currently own and run several websites.<br>
                <br>
                I'll be the first to admit that I'm not the greatest web dev in the world, but I can also say that my sites are fast, they look good, and they utilise so little JavaScript that they don't really rely on it. This is good because JS can be used for shady stuff just as easily as it can be used for perfectly legitimate stuff, so many users prefer to control what parts of sites are running JS code, or outright disable it across the board.<br>
                <br>
                My websites only utilise it for basic, and not very necessary functions, such as making scroll to top buttons work properly, making navigation menus turn into dropdowns when the screen width goes below a certain level, or auto-redirecting to the mobile version of a site when it detects the user is on a phone.<br>
                <br>
                If you were to turn off JS on my sites, the only things you'd lose are small quality of life improvements, the site as a whole would still work fine and you could still read everything on them without issue.

                I've been playing guitar since I was about 13, and I am currently the rhythm guitarist in <a href="https://trinitite.band/" target="blank">Trinitite</a>.
